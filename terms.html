      </ul>
    </section>

    <hr class="section-divider" />

    <section id="content-policy">
      <h2>5. Content Rules &amp; Community Standards</h2>
      <p>
        MyBox Studios is a curated platform. We reserve the right to decide, at our sole discretion, what content fits our brand, our
        community, and our legal obligations.
      </p>
      <h3>5.1 Prohibited Content</h3>
      <p>You agree not to upload, sell, or promote content that:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Is illegal, fraudulent, or promotes criminal activity.</li>
        <li>Contains threats of violence, harassment, or targeted hate against any person or group.</li>
        <li>Displays explicit sexual content, or content that is exploitative or abusive.</li>
        <li>Glorifies extreme violence, self-harm, or serious abuse.</li>
        <li>Infringes any copyright, trademark, or other intellectual property rights.</li>
        <li>Contains malware, spyware, or attempts to damage another person’s device or data.</li>
        <li>Is obviously misleading, scam-like, or designed to trick buyers.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>5.2 Complaints &amp; Reports</h3>
      <p>
        We may receive reports from customers, copyright owners, or other users about specific content or studios. We reserve the right to
        review, hide, limit, or remove content and/or studios at any time based on those reports and our internal review.
      </p>
    </section>

    <hr class="section-divider" />

    <section id="creator-terms">
      <h2>6. Creator Terms, Membership Fee &amp; Revenue Split</h2>

      <h3>6.1 Studio Membership Fee</h3>
      <p>
        To open a studio on MyBox Studios, we may charge a one-time Membership Fee (currently $100, subject to change). This fee grants you
        access to studio tools and the ability to list your content for sale on the platform.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Unless otherwise required by law, the Membership Fee is non-refundable, including if your studio is later suspended or
        terminated for violating these Terms.</strong>
      </p>

      <h3>6.2 Revenue Split &amp; Payments</h3>
      <p>
        Unless a different arrangement is agreed to in writing, the default revenue split is:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>80%</strong> of qualifying net sales to the creator; and</li>
        <li><strong>20%</strong> of qualifying net sales to MyBox Studios.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        “Net sales” generally means the amount received from the customer after payment processing fees, chargebacks, refunds, taxes, and
        similar costs are deducted. Payment timelines, minimum payout thresholds, and supported payout methods may change over time and will
        be communicated in your creator dashboard or support materials.
      </p>

      <h3>6.3 Your Responsibilities as a Creator</h3>
      <p>By opening a studio or selling content on MyBox Studios, you agree that:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>You own or have valid licenses to all content you upload and sell.</li>
        <li>You are responsible for the accuracy of descriptions, pricing, and any promises made to customers.</li>
        <li>You will comply with applicable tax laws in your jurisdiction.</li>
        <li>You will cooperate with us in resolving customer support issues related to your studio.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <hr class="section-divider" />

    <section id="suspension-termination">
      <h2>7. Studio Suspension &amp; Termination</h2>
      <p>
        MyBox Studios is a private platform, and access to our tools, storefronts, and studio pages is a privilege – not a right. To
        protect our community, our brand partners, and our visitors, we reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to suspend or permanently
        terminate any studio, page, or account at any time and for any reason, including but not limited to:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Uploading or distributing content that is illegal, fraudulent, or promotes criminal activity.</li>
        <li>Content that is hateful, harassing, or targets protected groups with threats, slurs, or abuse.</li>
        <li>Sexually explicit, extremely graphic, or otherwise inappropriate content not allowed under our content standards.</li>
        <li>Repeated copyright violations, DMCA complaints, or intellectual property infringement.</li>
        <li>Content that is misleading, scam-like, or designed to trick or exploit visitors.</li>
        <li>Repeated negative reports or complaints from customers or users that we determine, in our discretion, to be valid.</li>
        <li>Any other behavior that we believe harms MyBox Studios, our users, or our reputation.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>7.1 Our Process (When Possible)</h3>
      <p>In many cases, we will first:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Pause or hide specific pieces of content; and/or</li>
        <li>Send a warning to the email address on file explaining what needs to be fixed and by what date.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        However, <strong>we may remove content or shut down a studio without prior notice</strong> in urgent situations, including but not
        limited to serious legal risk, threats, or obvious abuse of the platform.
      </p>

      <h3>7.2 Effect of Termination</h3>
      <p>If your studio or account is suspended or terminated:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Your pages and content may be taken offline or hidden from public view.</li>
        <li>We may restrict your ability to create new content or access creator tools.</li>
        <li>
          Any pending payouts may be delayed, withheld, or reversed if we reasonably believe fraud, chargebacks, or violations of law
          or these Terms are involved.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Membership or access fees paid to MyBox Studios are generally non-refundable when termination is due to a violation of our
          rules or applicable law.</strong>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>You may contact support if you believe a suspension or termination was made in error. While we review reasonable appeals, decisions regarding platform access are ultimately made at our discretion.</p>

    <section id="purchases-refunds">
      <h2>8. Customer Purchases, Refunds &amp; Chargebacks</h2>
      <p>
        When you purchase content on MyBox Studios, you are buying access to digital goods. Because of the nature of digital content, all
        sales are generally considered final unless otherwise stated at checkout or required by law.
      </p>
      <p>
        We reserve the right, but are not obligated, to issue refunds or credits in special circumstances, such as defective files or clear
        technical errors. Chargebacks and payment disputes may result in your access to purchased content being revoked and, where relevant,
        studios being investigated or restricted.

    <hr class="section-divider" />

    <section id="dmca">
      <h2>9. Copyright, Ownership &amp; DMCA</h2>
      <p>
        Creators retain ownership of their original content but grant MyBox Studios a limited license to host, display, market, and process
        sales of that content on the platform.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you believe that content on MyBox Studios infringes your copyright, you may submit a notice to our designated contact:
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Email:</strong> <a href="mailto:support@myboxstudioslive.com">support@myboxstudioslive.com</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        Your notice should include sufficient detail to identify the work allegedly infringed, the material in question, and your contact
        information. We may remove or disable access to allegedly infringing content and may, in appropriate circumstances, suspend or
        terminate repeat infringers.
